Run qlearning.py to see what we have made

Feel free to try it with initial setups other than "dilemma.txt", we have provided 4 additional environments.

If you are running windows, set the gui_enabled flag to True to see the first and last episodes of each learning strategy.


Note: we reused some of our code from hw4 qlearning, but most of what is here is either brand new or significantly revamped.

We affirm that we adhered to the honor code in this assignment
